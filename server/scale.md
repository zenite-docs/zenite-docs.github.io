# Scaling

If your current server requires additional resources, you can scale the server up:

1. Click the "your-server-name.zenite.io" tab.
2. Click the "Scale up" tab.
3. Choose a new tier.
2. Click the "Scale" button.

The scaling process will shutdown your server for 10-15 minutes (possibly more, depending on the size of your disk).

After the scaling process has completed, the server will boot. From this point on, the server will be billed according the chosen tier.
