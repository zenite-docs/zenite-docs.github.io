# Server configuration

zenite servers are configured with sane defaults to accomodate the performance requirements of most users.

If required, any advanced configuration changes will have to be done by our support team. This includes changes to database server configuration files, changes to server configuration etc. If you require such changes, please contact us at support@zenite.io.

## Server specification

zenite makes an effort to use the recent Linux kernel version on all database servers. Currently running Linux kernel version:

```
4.15.13-x86_64
```

The servers are configured with minimal services required to run the database to keep the performance optimal.
