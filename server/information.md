# Server Information

> (server) > Information

The information tab contains the basic server information.

* Created on - the date server was created on
* Server Type - the server database type
* Last seen online - the last time zenite received a server heartbeat
* IP - the server public IP
* Server Region - the datacenter region the server resides on
* Server Tier - the server performance tier
* Price per Month - the price of the server on monthly basis. This price **will not** change if there are any pricing changes for the current server tier on zenite. The price of already deployed servers for a single tier will stay the same, always.

### Root credentials

You can use the root credentials to connect to the database server as root user with CLI or graphical clients (such as [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/), [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/), [Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/) etc.):

* Root username - the root user that has root access on the server. Use this user to access your server initially.
* Initial root password - the initial root user password.

For security purposes, it is recommended to change your initial root account password.
