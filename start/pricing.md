### Notes

* The invoice is generated from the amount spent at the end of each month (on the 1st of the new month for the previous month).
* The billing timer is active only while server is running. You will not be billed for any downtime (maintenance, user initiated scaling etc.).
* Payment must be (automatically) processed within 10 days at the end of each month. If the payment is not processed within 10 days (for example, due to the expired credit card) and the account still has overdue balance, we will be forced to terminate the service for that account.

### Balance and Invoices

You can view your current uninvoiced balance and past invoices in the `Balance / Invoices` section under the `Settings` tab.

Each past invoice include a printable PDF you can download by clicking a download button in the grid.
