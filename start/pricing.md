### Notes

* The invoice is generated from the amount spent at the end of each month (on the 1st for the previous month).
* The billing timer is active only while server is running. You will not be billed for any downtime (maintenance, user initiated scaling etc.)
* Payment for each month must be (automatically) processed within 10 days after the end of the month. If the payment is more than 10 days overdue (for example, due to the expired credit card) we will be forced to delete the servers for overdue accounts.
