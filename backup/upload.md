### Upload

You can upload the existing backups to zenite with the following actions:

1. Click "Choose Files..." button and select an archive you want to restore.
2. Click the "Upload" button.
3. After the file has been uploaded, click the restore icon (arrow up) in the grid to restore the database onto the server.

> Depending on the size of the database, the restore process may take some time. You can check the status of the restore process in the Tasks panel in the header (the cog icon).
