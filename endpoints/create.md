# Creating an endpoint

> Navigation: your-server-name.zenite.io -> Endpoints -> New Endpoint...

1. Choose an endpoint name and enter it in the input filed. The endpoint name will define the URL through which the endpoint is accessed. Read more on endpoint naming in [General configuration](endpoints/general.md).
2. Your endpoint is now created. You can configure it by clicking on the tab with a newly created endpoint name that appeared in the navigation.

For instructions on how to configure the endpoint further, read the Endpoint section in the docs.
