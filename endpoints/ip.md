# IP Addresses

> (server) > Endpoints > (endpoint) > IP Addresses

You can restrict the endpoint access to specific IP addresses.

By default, endpoints allow all IP addresses.

To configure the endpoint to only allow specific IP addresses, uncheck `Allow all IP Addresses` checkbox and enter the allowed IP addresses in the input field below, in the following format (one IP address per line):

```
8.8.8.8
8.8.4.4
```

To add the current user IP to the list, click the `Add current user IP` button.

Save the settings by clicking the `Save` button.
