# IP Addresses

> Navigation: your-server-name.zenite.io -> Endpoints -> your-endpoint-name -> IP Addresses

You can restrict the endpoint access to specific IP addresses.

By default, endpoints allow all IP addresses.

To configure the endpoint to only allow specific IP addresses, uncheck "Allow all IP Addresses" checkbox and enter the allowed IP addresses in the input field below, in the following format (one IP address per line):

```
8.8.8.8
8.8.4.4
```

To add the current user IP to the list, click "Add current user IP".

Save the settings by clicking "Save".
