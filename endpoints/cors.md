> (server) > Endpoints > (endpoint) > CORS

If you are issuing endpoint requests from a browser, you can restrict the endpoint access to specific CORS origins.

By default, endpoints allow all CORS origins.

To configure CORS to only allow specific origins, uncheck `Allow all Origins` checkbox and enter the allowed origin addresses in the input field below, in the following format (one address per line):

```
https://example1.com
https://example2.com
```

Save the settings by clicking the `Save` button.
