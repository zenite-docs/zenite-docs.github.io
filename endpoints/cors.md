If you are issuing endpoint requests from the browser, you can restrict the endpoint access to specific CORS origins.

By default, endpoint allows all CORS origins.

To configure CORS to only allow specific origins, uncheck "Allow all Origins" checkbox and enter the allowed origin addresses in the input field below, in the following format (one address per line):

```
https://example1.com
https://example2.com
```

Save the settings by clicking the "Save" button.
