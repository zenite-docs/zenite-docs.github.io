# zenite

zenite is a service which enables the users to create databases (MariaDB, PostgreSQL or MongoDB) on high-performance servers and define a custom API to access or modify the database data. It also enables the users to create backups, either manual or through user defined schedules. It also features running database queries directly from the web application.
