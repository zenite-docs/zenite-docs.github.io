zenite is a cloud based Database-as-a-Service platform which enables you to:

* deploy and host databases ([MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) or [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)) on high-performance servers with SSD drives.
* create a secure (HTTPS) REST API to access or modify the database data using raw SQL or MongoDB queries.
* create backups automatically, through predefined cron jobs.
* query the database directly from the web application.

## Quick start

1. Register at https://portal.zenite.io/register
2. Verify your email and login with your credentials at https://portal.zenite.io
3. Create a server and connect to your database.

## Billing

zenite is billed using pay-as-you-go payment model. Servers are billed by the minute for the time the server remains online, so you only pay for what you use.

### Trial

You can try zenite for free for **10 days** on the Standard 1024 tier (read more on tiers [here](start/pricing.md)). Before the trial period ends, you will need to enter the billing information to prevent your servers from being deleted.

After the billing information is entered, the trial period will end and you will be able to use the full feature version of zenite.
