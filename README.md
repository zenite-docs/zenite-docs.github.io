# zenite

zenite is a Database-as-a-Service platform which enables the users to deploy databases (MariaDB, PostgreSQL or MongoDB) on high-performance servers and define a custom secure (HTTPS) API to access or modify the database data through user defined queries. It also enables the users to create backups, either manual or through predefined schedules. It also features running database queries directly from the web application.
